nAspirin

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  It works on the TI-NSpire CX CAS with ndless 3.1.  At this time I don't know about whether it will work on other models.  The gameplay is quite simple; where you just collect the item and watch out for the lines.  This game is based on the TI-89 version which is based off of a Flash game.

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-srop the nAspirin-sdl.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 on your calculator in order to run it!

How to play:
Navigate the menu using the arrow keys (or 2,4,6,8 keys) and the Enter key to start a new game of the level of difficulty you prefer.
You move the yellowish circle using the arrow keys (or 2,4,6,8 keys).
Watch out for the red lines as a collision will mean end of the game.
And try to collect as many of the items as you can!

When you collect an item another line shows up.  Have fun!

I included my source.  I programmed with C++ which you can find out more here: http://blog.tangrs.id.au/?p=712  It uses nSDL as well as the ndless Software Development Kit.
